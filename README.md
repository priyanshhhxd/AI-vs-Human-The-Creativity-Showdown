# 🤖 AI vs Human: The Creativity Showdown

An interactive web app where humans and AI face off in a battle of creativity.  
Users type prompts (like a poem, joke, or quote), write their own response, and then see what AI comes up with.  
The app compares both responses side by side to see if machine logic can ever beat human soul, humor, and heart.
